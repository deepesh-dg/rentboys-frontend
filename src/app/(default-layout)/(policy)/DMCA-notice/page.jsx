                    The SITE implements the following "notification and
                    takedown" procedure upon receipt of any notification of
                    claimed copyright infringement. The SITE reserves the right
                    at any time to disable access to, or remove any material or
                    activity accessible on or from any SITE or any Materials
                    claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances
                    from which infringing activity is apparent. It is the firm
                    policy of the SITE to terminate the account of repeat
                    copyright infringers, when appropriate, and the SITE will
                    act expeditiously to remove access to all material that
                    infringes on another's copyright, according to the procedure
                    set forth in 17 U.S.C. #512 of the Digital Millennium
                    Copyright Act ("DMCA"). The SITE's DMCA Notice Procedures
                    are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the notice does
                    not comply with #512 of the DMCA, but does comply with three
                    requirements for identifying sites that are infringing
                    according to #512 of the DMCA, the SITE shall attempt to
                    contact or take other reasonable steps to contact the
                    complaining party to help that party comply with the notice
                    requirements. When the Designated Agent receives a valid
                    notice, the SITE will expeditiously remove and/or disable
                    access to the infringing material and shall notify the
                    affected user. Then, the affected user may submit a
                    counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a
                    statement made under penalty of perjury that the user has a
                    good faith belief that the material was removed because of
                    misidentification of the material. After the Designated
                    Agent receives the counter-notification, it will replace the
                    material at issue within 10-14 days after receipt of the
                    counter-notification unless the Designated Agent receives
                    notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining
                    party seeking an injunction against the infringing activity.
                    The SITE reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this
                    policy, and all users should regularly check back to these.

                    If the Recipient of a Notice of Claimed Infringement

                    and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly
                    removed in accordance with the procedures outlined above,
                    the Recipient is permitted to submit a counter-notification
                    pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)&(3) of the DMCA. A
                    counter-notification is the proper method for the Recipient
                    to dispute the removal or disabling of material pursuant to
                    a Notice. The information that a Recipient provides in a
                    counter-notification must be accurate and truthful, and the
                    Recipient will be liable for any misrepresentations which
                    may cause any claims to be brought against the SITE relating
                    to the actions taken in response to the
                    counter-notification. To submit a counter-notification,
                    please provide Our Designated Copyright agent the following
                    information: (a) a specific description of the material that
                    was removed or disabled pursuant to the Notice; (b) a
                    description of where the material was located within the
                    SITE or the Content before such material was removed and/or
                    disabled (preferably including specific url's associated
                    with the material); (c) a statement reflecting the
                    Recipient's belief that the removal or disabling of the
                    material was done so erroneously. For convenience, the
                    following format may be used: "I swear, under penalty of
                    perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the referenced
                    material was removed or disabled by the service provider as
                    a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to
                    be removed or disabled." (d) the Recipient's physical
                    address, telephone number, and email address; and, (e) a
                    statement that the Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of
                    the Federal District Court in and for the judicial district
                    where the Recipient is located, or if the Recipient is
                    outside of the United States, for any judicial district in
                    which the service provider may be found, and that the
                    Recipient will accept service of process from the person who
                    provided the Notice, or that person's agent.
